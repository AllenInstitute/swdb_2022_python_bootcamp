    "<p>Without containing python packages in isolated environments, you might get faced with conflicting dependencies. Suppose you have a python library for a project that only works <i>up to</i> python version 3.7 and you have another library for a different project that only works <i>from</i> python 3.8. If you want to run these libraries independently of each other, then it is easily done by creating separate conda environments: one that runs against python 3.7, and one that runs against python 3.8. Overall, conda allows you to:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li> Ensure your code and dependencies are platform independent (there are occasional caveats)\n",
    "<li> Run a specific version of python\n",
    "<li> Easily install a curated list of dependencies\n",
    "<li> Easily share your code and package dependencies (it was a common problem before conda that code works fine on your machine, but others wer unable to run it)\n",
    "<li> No risk of messing up your system libraries (your operating system might be running python packages and you might brick your computer if you mess around with system libraries!)\n",
